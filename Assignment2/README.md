Using Simple feedforward Model:
For 50 epoch i got around 30% accuracy.

To run the code:
just run the notebook in order. It will give test_label_part1.json file with label columns added.

(for part2 i have tried using the Bert for getting contextual embeddings but it's taking to much time to give those embeddings(estimated=50 days), I have just submitted the notebook. This is the reason i have submitted late)
